			<div class="info">
				
					<ul>
						<li>You own and control the money in your health savings account.</li>
						<li>You do not pay taxes on money going into your HSA or any investment growth.</li>
						<li>Money contributed is with pre-tax dollars which reduce your taxes based on your tax rate.</li>
						<li>Any unused money at the end of the year rolls over (stays in your account) year over year.</li>
						<li>It is portable</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="info">
				<p>
					You must be under the age of 65 and participate in a HDHP. If you have a spouse who uses your insurance as secondary coverage, he or she also must be enrolled in a HDHP. The HDHP must be your only health insurance, however, having dental, vision, disability and long term care insurance does not disqualify you from having an HSA.
